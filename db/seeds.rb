Juan stated his traffic signal was green and he did not see the pedestrian until it was too late. He said the pedestrian was struck with the right front bumper and passenger side mirror.

Dillon # 72; Sgt. R. Adkins; and I were dispatched to the intersection of E. Main St. (US 40) and S. Hamilton Rd. (SR 317) on a report of a pedestrian struck by a vehicle.  We arrived to the scene with Medic # 23. The pedestrian struck was in a motorized wheelchair and was identified as Tavionna Spencer. She was checked by medics for a minor injury to her left knee (there was a visible scrape.) She refused any medical treatment or to be transported to the hospital. She spoke with Sgt. Adkins about what happened. She told him that she had been on the N/W corner of S. Hamilton Rd. and E. Main St. She crossed E/B in the crosswalk on the north side of the intersection and stated she had a walk signal in her sign to cross. She stated Unit # 1; a gold Ford Escape; had been W/B on E. Main St. in the curb lane at the intersection of S. Hamilton Rd. and made a right turn onto N/B S. Hamilton Rd. She stated Unit # 1 struck her while she was crossing in the crosswalk. I later took photographs of Spencer and her wheelchair. The control stick on the right arm area of the wheelchair and light damage from the crash; along with the scrape on Spencer's knee. Spencer was unable to write a statement due to physical impairment.  I spoke with witness; Karin Siemens; who told me she was riding a bicycle and was on the N/E corner of the intersection preparing to cross E. Main St. on the east side of the intersection to the S/E corner of the intersection; she was there with two other pedestrians. She stated she observed the wheelchair on the N/W corner of the intersection by CVS Pharmacy. She  She said she got the walk signal and began to cross and heard the crash; but didn't see it. She said if she had the walk signal the wheelchair had to have the \"Don't Walk\" signal. I asked her if she saw Unit # 1; and she said the Ford Escape was N/B on S. Hamilton Rd. and didn't make any turns. She provided a written statement.  The two other pedestrians that had been standing with Siemens were identified by Officer M. Dillon as Anitra Howard and Joshua Anderson. Anitra told Officer Dillon that she observed Unit # 1; W/B on E. Main St. in the curb lane at the intersection of S. Hamilton Rd. Unit # 1 was preparing to turn right (N/B) onto S. Hamilton Rd. She said she saw the wheelchair crossing from the N/W corner of the intersection to the N/E corner in the crosswalk and had a \"walk\" signal. The driver of Unit # 1 proceeded to make its right turn onto S. Hamilton Rd. and struck the wheelchair (Unit # 2.) Joshua Anderson told Officer Dillon that he heard the crash but didn't see it. They both provided written statements to Officer Dillon.  I spoke with the driver of Unit # 1; Dorothy Johnson. She told me she had been N/B on S. Hamilton Rd. in the curb lane stopped at a red light at the intersection of E. Main St. When the light turned green for her she proceeded to go N/B in the curb lane. She said she never saw the wheelchair and then heard a \"thud\" she turned around and came back to the scene to find out she had collided with a wheelchair. She estimated her speed at around 10 mph. Johnson couldn't provide a written statement due to physical impairment. I checked her vehicle and found damage on the left rear side where plastic molding around rear wheel well had been partially ripped off. This was consistent with the height of the control stick of the wheelchair. Photographs were taken of the vehicle.   I checked with Sunoco Gas Station and they didn't have video surveillance that showed the intersection. Officer Dillon checked with CVS Pharmacy and retrieved their video surveillance that is pointed at the intersection. The intersection however is too far away and you can't tell what took place or who was at fault. A copy of the video was placed with this report.   Due to conflicting statements at this time the at fault Unit has not been determined.
